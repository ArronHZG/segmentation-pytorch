# Introduction
Since 2015, **UNet** has made major breakthroughs in the medical image segmentation , opening the era of deep learning. Later researchers have made a lot of improvements on the basis of UNet in order to improve the performance of semantic segmentation.

In this project, we have compiled the semantic segmentation models related to UNet(**UNet family**) in recent years.
My implementation is mainly based on **pytorch**, and other implementations are collected from author of original paper or excellent repositories. For the record, this project is still **under construction**. If you have any advice or question, please raise an issue or contact me from email.
 
Furthermore, why does the UNet neural network perform well in medical image segmentation?
You can figure it out from [my answer](https://www.zhihu.com/question/269914775/answer/586501606) in Zhihu.
